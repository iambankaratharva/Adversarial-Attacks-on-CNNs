# Adversarial-Attacks-on-CNNs
Utilizing the gradients of the network, we create adversarial images designed to closely resemble the originals. This manipulation fools several neural networks and reveals a security vulnerability in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that could be exploited by malicious users.
